## Technical Details

### How Fingerprinting Protection Works

Every website you visit attempts to identify you through dozens of data points:

- Canvas fingerprinting: Asking your browser to draw text and extracting pixel data
- WebGL information: GPU type and capabilities
- Screen resolution and color depth
- Installed fonts and plugins
- Language and timezone settings
- User agent (browser and OS info)

PrivacyX defeats these techniques by:

1. **Randomization**: Injecting random noise into canvas data
2. **Spoofing**: Returning false information for system queries
3. **Blocking**: Preventing enumeration APIs from working
4. **Rotation**: Changing your profile on each visit

The result is that no two visits from your browser appear identical, making it impossible to build a persistent profile.

### Data Clearing Architecture

When you click "Clear," PrivacyX uses Firefox's native clearing APIs:

```
Browser Data → Firefox Clear APIs → Permanent Removal
↓
- History
- Cookies
- Cache
- Plugins Data
- Passwords (optional)
- etc.
```

All clearing happens locally in your browser. No data is sent anywhere.

### Protection Mode Differences

**Standard Mode**
- Baseline spoofing for all fingerprinting vectors
- Maintains compatibility with most websites
- Recommended for daily use

**Enhanced Mode**
- More aggressive spoofing and randomization
- Some websites might detect the extension
- Better privacy, minor compatibility tradeoff

**Stealth Mode**
- Maximum protection with all features enabled
- Some sites may refuse service
- Experimental—use only when maximum privacy is essential

## Permissions Explained

PrivacyX requests the following permissions. Here's why each is necessary:

| Permission | Why We Need It |
|------------|----------------|
| Clear browsing history | To clear your browsing data on demand |
| Access clipboard | To assist with password/data management features |
| Read browsing history | To show you what can be cleared |
| Display notifications | To notify you of completed operations |
| Access browser tabs | To manage tab closing and data |
| Access websites | To apply spoofing and protect against fingerprinting |

We never store or transmit this data. Everything happens locally.

## Troubleshooting

### Some Websites Aren't Loading Properly

Enhanced spoofing can occasionally cause compatibility issues. Try these steps:

1. Click the PrivacyX icon
2. Go to **Advanced** tab
3. Change Protection Mode to **Standard**
4. Reload the problematic website
5. If that works, switch back to Enhanced with fewer features enabled

### I'm Still Seeing Tracking Requests

PrivacyX blocks known trackers, but new ones emerge daily. If you notice:

1. Document the tracker domain
2. [Open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/mixaoc/PrivacyX/issues)
3. Include the domain and any error messages
4. We'll add it to the blocklist in the next update

### The Extension Feels Slow

If PrivacyX impacts your browsing speed:

1. Try disabling Enhanced/Stealth mode temporarily
2. Clear your browsing cache (Cleaner tab)
3. Disable auto-rotation if enabled
4. Restart Firefox

If problems persist, [check existing issues](https://github.com/mixaoc/PrivacyX/issues) or create a new one with your Firefox version and system specs.
